# IoT based smart irrigation system Bangladesh perspective

IoT based smart irrigation system Bangladesh-perspective project is targeted to prototype an IoT based smart irrigation system that will measure the soil moisture in real time, compare it with reference moisture value and control the irrigation process (e.g., notifying the farmer over sms, turn on / off the irrigation pump automatically). Additionally, the system will log the moisture reading and irrigation data in the cloud storage for further analysis and decision-making.
